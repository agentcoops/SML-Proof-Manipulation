(* Files Created/Changed *)

1. src/Pure/tisarhelp.ML: 
Herein are defined various helper functions for my work on tisar. If
you know where similar/simpler/more efficient methods are defined in
either the PolyML standard basis or the bowls of Isabelle, please let
me know as many of these implementations are rather sloppy
placeholders.

2. src/Pure/negatableformula.ML:
This file defines the signature of the "negatable formula" that is
required by the proof graph datatype and hence tisar. A sample
implementation is provided for TSTP.

3. src/Pure/proofgraph.ML:
The make

4. src/Pure/tisar.ML:

5. src/Pure/General/graph.ML: 
Made some slight changes to this file that I'm presently factoring out
to aid in the merge. The following methods were added:

reverse_edge
filter
filter_nodes

6. src/Pure/tests.ML:
This defines the "tests" I've been using to make sure that tisar is
working as expected. This is still rather manual, unfortunately, and
my workflow has been to compare the tisar generated to Jasmin's
handwritten solutions to the challenge proofs in the gallery.

This remains the best documentation on the use of this library: load
the files indicated at the top of tests.ML and follow the examples for
TSTP proofs of interest.
