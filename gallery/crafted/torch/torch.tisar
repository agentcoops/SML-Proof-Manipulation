Naive:

  have 7 | 8

  {
     assume 7
     hence 5
     hence 3 | 4

     {
        assume 3
        hence 0 by 1
     }
     moreover
     {
        assume 4
        hence 0 by 2
     }
     ultimately have 0 by '3 | 4'
  }
  moreover
  {
     assume 8
     hence 6
     hence 3 | 4

     {
        assume 3
        hence 0 by 1
     }
     moreover
     {
        assume 4
        hence 0 by 2
     }
     ultimately have 0 by '3 | 4'
  }
  ultimately show 0 by '7 | 8'

Better:

  have 7 | 8

  {
     assume 7
     hence 5
     hence 3 | 4
  }
  moreover
  {
     assume 8
     hence 6
     hence 3 | 4
  }
  ultimately have '3 | 4' by '7 | 8'

  {
     assume 3
     hence 0 by 1
  }
  moreover
  {
     assume 4
     hence 0 by 2
  }
  ultimately have 0 by '3 | 4'
