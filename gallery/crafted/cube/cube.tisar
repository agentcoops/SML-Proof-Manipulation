Naive:

  have 3 | 5 | 6

  {
    assume 3
    hence 1 | 2

    {
      assume 1
      hence 0
    }
    moreover
    {
      assume 2
      hence 0
    }
    ultimately have 0 by '1 | 2'
  }
  moreover
  {
    assume 5
    hence 1 | 4

    {
      assume 1
      hence 0
    }
    moreover
    {
      assume 4
      hence 0
    }
    ultimately have 0 by '1 | 4'
  }
  moreover
  {
    assume 6
    hence 2 | 4
    {
      assume 2
      hence 0
    }
    moreover
    {
      assume 4
      hence 0
    }
    ultimately have 0 by '2 | 4'
  }
  ultimately show 0 by '3 | 5 | 6'

Better:

  have 3 | 5 | 6

  {
    assume 3
    hence 1 | 2  (* need to work on fact that doesn't handle trivial branches! *)
  }
  moreover
  {
    assume 5
    hence 1 | 4
  }
  moreover
  {
    assume 6
    hence 2 | 4
  }
  ultimately have 1 | 2 | 4 by '3 | 5 | 6'

  {
    assume 1
    hence 0
  }
  moreover
  {
    assume 2
    hence 0
  }
  moreover
  {
    assume 4
    hence 0
  }
  ultimately show 0 by '1 | 2 | 4'

(* think I need to remove the insert disjunction step in proof-graph
generation such that simplification branches can be detected!!! *)
