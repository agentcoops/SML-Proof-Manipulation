The TPTP and TSTP files were generated using the call

    sledgehammer [remote_waldmeister, erased, overlord]
                 (huntington sup_assoc sup_comm)

immediately after the statement of lemma "huntington_id" in
"Robbins-Conjecture/Robbins_Conjecture.thy" from the Archive of Formal Proofs
[1]. The files were very lightly hand-edited.

The file "huntington_id.thy" has a complete setup to replay the original
proof as well as two versions of the proof found by Waldmeister.
