The TPTP and TSTP files were generated using

    lemma "map f [x] = [f x]"
    sledgehammer [remote_waldmeister, erased, overlord] (map.simps)

The files were very lightly hand-edited.

The ".thy" file is an Isabelle file that shows the same proof in Isar, at
different levels of granularity. The ".tisar" file (ad hoc TPTP Isar-like
language) shows what the output of the proof manipulation framework at the
TPTP/TSTP level could be (point (2) of "README").
