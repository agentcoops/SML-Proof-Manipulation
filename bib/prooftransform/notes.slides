Slide 1: This shows a ATP proof of "rev [a, b] = [b, a]" ("the reverse
of the list [a, b] is the list [b, a] for all a, b") reconstructed in
Isabelle as a proof by contradiction. This is what we get following
Paulson & Susanto.

Slide 2: The same proof redirected. This is what the current code
does, which I wrote last year.

Slide 4: Pretend we want to prove a formula of the form "1 or 2 or 3",
where 1, 2, and 3 stand for conjunctions of literals (e.g. "x = y or y
= z or a = b").

Slide 5: ATPs assume the negated conjecture.

Slide 6: ATPs get a certain number of other facts (axioms), say, 4 to
200, and here three of them (35, 89, and 136) are used in a resolution
proof.

Slide 7: The resolution proof derives new clauses from the negated
conjecture and the axioms. For example, 505 is a logical consequence
of 35 and 89 taken together. At the end we get False (bottom).

Slide 9: Paulson & Susanto's approach reconstructs the proof step by
step in Isabelle, using Metis for each inference step.

Slide 12: If we want to redirect the proof, we want to prove 1, 2, or
3, instead of assuming not 1, not 2, and not 3.

Slides 13 and 14: The clauses 505 and 508 were derived directly from
the axioms; they are not tainted by the negated conjecture. These are
"green" facts which we can derive directly the same way as before.

Slide 15: The clauses 653 and 654 and the conclusion False are tainted
by the negated conjecture (i.e., they depend on it, directly or
indirectly). These are "orange" facts and these must be flipped
around.

Slide 16: By the contrapositive, "653 and 654 implies False" becomes
"True implies not-653 or not-654". Notice the "or" -- a case split!

Slide 17: "not-3 and 508 implies 653" becomes "508 and not 653 implies
3". No case split this time. (Case splits occur when several tainted
facts appear as premises of an inference rule (e.g. 653 and 654
implies False). When a single tainted fact occurs, or none, there is
no case split.)

Slide 18: Similarly for "not-2 and 505 implies 654".

Slide 21: When reconstructing the proof in Isabelle, we start by
deriving the green facts.

Slide 22: Then we perform a case split.
